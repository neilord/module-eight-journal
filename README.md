1. Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room was the client, a company looking to expand their game "Draw It or Lose It" to multiple computing platforms. They wanted software designed that would allow their game to run consistently across various operating systems while maintaining performance and user experience.

2. What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

In developing this documentation, I believe I did particularly well in providing comprehensive and detailed recommendations for the operating platform, storage management, and security considerations. The Linux-based server platform recommendation was well-justified with clear advantages outlined.

3. What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Working through a design document was helpful as it provided a clear structure and roadmap for the software development process. It ensured that all key aspects - from operating systems to security - were systematically considered and addressed before any coding began.

4. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I could revise one part, I would expand on the Distributed Systems and Networks section. I would improve it by providing more specific examples of how to implement the client-server architecture and RESTful APIs for The Gaming Room's specific game requirements. I would also include more details on handling potential network issues and ensuring seamless gameplay across different platforms.

5. How did you interpret the user's needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user's needs when designing?

I interpreted the user's needs by focusing on their requirements for cross-platform compatibility, scalability, and security. These needs were implemented into the software design through recommendations like using a Linux-based server platform, implementing efficient memory management techniques, and suggesting robust security measures. Considering user needs is crucial in software design because it ensures the final product meets client expectations, provides a positive user experience, and solves the actual problems the client is facing.

6. How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

My approach to designing software involved analyzing the client's requirements, researching suitable technologies, and proposing solutions that balanced performance, cost-effectiveness, and scalability. In the future, I would use similar strategies of requirement analysis and technology evaluation. Additionally, I would emphasize more on user feedback and iterative development to refine the design throughout the process. I would also consider incorporating more detailed prototyping and testing phases to ensure the design meets all requirements before full-scale development begins.
